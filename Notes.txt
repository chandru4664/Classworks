DOM manipulation
If you are familier with traditional javascript dom or using frameowkr like jquery, all of your business logic is always work with dom manipulatuon.  adding element, revoidn glements, hide elements..etc. any kind of opeations you want to make as part of dom maniplations... that part shuld be sperated form the busines slgoc or papplicatin logic 
which is essentially talk to web services like rest services.

MVC pattern
Angular JS follows much of MVC pattern.
we have models which is having data
view - DOM, with all kinds of diretives, you can say plain html 
controllers will be having business logic, which need to worked with Webservices/Rest Services
	get in touch with server.
	controllers put data fectehc into model and and bind model to view.
	
In this way each of these components works seperately, and can be tested seperately.
